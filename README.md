# INTRODUCTION TO SHOPLAKE
SHOPLAKE is a fullstack E-commerce website built using MERN(MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It is designed for  online electronic retail, allowing users to browse and shop for various electronics products. The purpose of this project is to showcase my frontend and backend skills using MERN stack. This site includes lots of functionality like Admin for product stock and management and User dashboard and braintree payment gateway(sandbox) with credit card.
